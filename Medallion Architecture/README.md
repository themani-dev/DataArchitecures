# 🏛️ Medallion Architecture on Data Lakehouse

The **Medallion Architecture** is a robust, modular framework for managing and scaling modern data pipelines in a **Data Lakehouse**. It structures data transformation across layered stages — **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** — enabling better data quality, governance, and usability for downstream analytics and machine learning.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Layers

### 🥉 Bronze Layer — Raw Ingestion

- Stores **unprocessed** or **lightly parsed** raw data.
- Ingested from sources like files, APIs, streams, or RDBMS.
- Serves as a source of truth for audit and replay.

> 🧹 Technologies: GCS/S3, Kafka, Pub/Sub, Azure Blob, Delta Lake

---

### 🥐 Silver Layer — Cleansed & Modeled

- Performs **data cleaning**, **validation**, and **join operations**.
- Applies schemas and transformations.
- Ready for intermediate analytical use.

> 🚰 Technologies: BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks Delta, Apache Hudi

---

### 🥇 Gold Layer — Business Curated

- Contains **aggregated**, **business-ready**, and **domain-modeled** data.
- Designed for dashboards, KPIs, machine learning, and reporting.

> 📊 Technologies: Looker, Tableau, Power BI, Vertex AI

---

## 📌 Why Use Medallion Architecture?

- ✅ **Modularity**: Separate layers for ingest, processing, and consumption.
- 🔁 **Reusability**: Raw data can be reused for different transformations.
- 🔍 **Observability**: Easier lineage tracking and data auditing.
- 📈 **Scalability**: Works well with cloud-native architectures and streaming data.
- 🔐 **Security & Governance**: Apply access policies layer-wise based on sensitivity.

## ⚖️ Pros and Cons

| Pros ✅                                           | Cons ⚠️                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Clear data lineage and transformation flow       | Increased storage due to multi-layered data |
| Fault isolation and easy recovery at layer level | Added complexity in orchestration           |
| Enhances data quality and trust                  | Higher cost if not well-governed            |
| Encourages domain-driven data modeling           | Requires well-defined governance policies   |
| Supports both batch and streaming paradigms      | May introduce latency between layers        |
