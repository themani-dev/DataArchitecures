# 🏗️ Cloud Data Engineering Architectures – AWS | GCP | Azure

Welcome to the **Cloud Data Engineering Architectures** repository — a curated collection of production-ready **batch and streaming architecture patterns** across **AWS**, **GCP**, and **Azure**.

> 🌟 This repository is designed to help Data Engineers and Architects evaluate, compare, and implement architectures that align with their **business goals**, **data maturity**, and **platform preferences**.

---

## 🚀 Project Goal

Cloud data architectures are not one-size-fits-all. Choosing the right architecture requires balancing:

- ✅ **Latency** needs (batch vs real-time)
- 💸 **Cost-efficiency**
- 📈 **Scalability and growth**
- 🔐 **Governance and observability**
- 🧹 **Tool interoperability**

This repository enables **informed decision-making** by providing **reference implementations** of the most common architectures across **cloud platforms**.

## 🧱 Repository Structure

Each architecture is organized by name, and under each you'll find cloud-specific implementations:

```
├── LambdaArchitecture/
│   ├── AWS/
│   │   └── diagrams/
│   ├── GCP/
│   └── Azure/
│
├── KappaArchitecture/
│   ├── AWS/
│   │   └── diagrams/
│   ├── GCP/
│   └── Azure/
│
├── MedallionArchitecture/
│   ├── AWS/
│   │   └── diagrams/
│   ├── GCP/
│   └── Azure/
│
└── ...
```

Each cloud folder contains:

- 📄 `README.md`: architecture-specific cloud implementation guide
- 🪰 Infrastructure as Code (Terraform / ARM / Deployment Manager)
- 🖼️ `diagrams/`: Architecture diagrams (Mermaid / PNG / Lucid)
- 🔧 Optional dummy data & simulation setup

## ☁️ Platform-Specific Patterns

Each architecture is implemented using **native cloud tools** for each provider: (**In Progress**)

| Feature       | AWS                        | GCP                        | Azure                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Batch         | S3, Glue, Athena, Redshift | BigQuery, Dataflow (batch) | ADLS, Synapse, Data Factory         |
| Streaming     | Kinesis, Flink, MSK        | Pub/Sub, Dataflow, Beam    | Event Hubs, Stream Analytics        |
| Storage       | S3, Redshift, DynamoDB     | GCS, BigQuery, Firestore   | ADLS, Synapse, Cosmos DB            |
| Orchestration | MWAA, Step Functions       | Cloud Composer, Workflows  | Data Factory, Logic Apps            |
| Monitoring    | CloudWatch, OpenTelemetry  | Cloud Monitoring, Logging  | Azure Monitor, Application Insights |

## 🧠 Decision-Making Guide

This repo is your **cloud-native architecture compass**. Use it to:

- Compare the same architecture across AWS, GCP, and Azure
- Make trade-off decisions: latency vs throughput, serverless vs managed, etc.
- Align your architecture to business use cases (e.g., fraud detection, IoT, real-time analytics)
- Evaluate tool maturity and service cost implications
- Kickstart implementations with IaC, diagrams, and examples
